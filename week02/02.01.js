/*
    Challenge:
    Create a variable named FB that takes numbers
    Write an ELSE/IF conditional that: 
    Prints out "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
    Prints out "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
    Prints out "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5
    Convert this to SWITCH STATEMENT and then a TERNARY

 FOR OF LOOPS

    - For Of Loops parse through an iterable list of numbers - so that makes them great for working with arrays
    - Arrays contain what are known as iterable properties. Each property - or value - in an array, each contains it's own index (the first item in an array has an index of 0, and so on). 
                     value
